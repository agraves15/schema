= Schema

Schema[https://schemacolors.herokuapp.com/] allows users to collaboratively create color schemes. Users can share schemes they create with friends, who can then edit them as they see fit.

== Framework
Schema was built with Ruby on Rails for my CIS196 final project. It uses the following extra gems:
* jquery-minicolors-rails[https://github.com/kostia/jquery-minicolors-rails] for color selection
* simple_form[https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form] for adding color selection to forms
* has_friendship[https://github.com/sungwoncho/has_friendship] for friendship relationships between users
* bcrypt[https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby] for passwords
* bootstrap-sass[https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass] for style
* to_words[https://github.com/taimur-akhtar/to_words] for converting numbers into words
